#Hello World#
-------------------
##Preface
*This time is 3/13/2016*

Hello world~My name is ziling,I really want to make my computer skills better,so I choose to learn things.This file you can see just some notes for beginner,if you think this things will help you that  would make me feel good.
Although I will tell you that My English is so poor, so you can see many errors in this poor notes,haaaa~ : ) 
Maybe this file has no one to read,but I will try my best to do!
Wish you have fun~
##The Start 	**C++**

**First I will told some information about the language.**
- The C++ primier 5 edition 
- Hasome vedioes from youtube [The Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MKhigIml3E&list=PLmpc3xvYSk4wDCP5zjt2QQXe8-JGHa4Kt)

**Now the wonderful world is coming!**

 **Function**
 A function definition has four elements: a function name,a(posibly empty)parameter list, a return type,and a function body.
 Here is the example:
 

    #include <iostream>
    int main()
    {
        std::cout << "Enter two  numbers:" << std::endl;
        int v1 = 0, v2 = 0;
        std::cin >> v1 >> v2;
        std::cout << "The sum of" << v1 << "and" << v2
                  << "is" << v1+v2 << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }

>**Tips: **the output operator "<<",the left-hand operand must be an ostream;the right-hand operand is a value on the given ostream.

Here is the tips' example:

     std::cout << "Enter two  numbers:" << std::endl;
     //follow sentence is the same
      std::cout << "Enter two  numbers:" 
      std::cout << std::endl;
Writing **endl** has the effect of ending the current line and flushing the **buffer** associated with  that device.Flushing the buffer ensures that all the output is written to the output stream,rather than sitting in memory waiting to be written.

###Home work (1.3-1.6)
Exercise1.3

    #include <iostream>
    int main()
    {
         //This is not the First time to write down this but I feel it very happy~Hope you have the same felling :ï¼‰
        std::cout << "Hello World~" << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }
Exercise1.4

    #include<iostreame>
    int main()
    {
        std::cout << "Enter two numbers to multiplication:" << std::endl;
        int v1 = 0,v2 = 0;
        std::cin >> v1 >> V2;
        std::cout << "The" << v1 << "multiplication" << v2 << "is"
        << V1*V2 << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }
Exercise1.5

    #include<iostreame>
    int main()
    { 
        std::cout << "This may be fine";
        std::cout << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }
Exercise1.6
I guss it is legal.
The CMD will show:
*The sum of V1 and V2 is V1+V2*


**The While Statement**
Here is the example:

    #include<iostream>
    int main()
    {
        int sum = 0, val = 1;
        //keep executing the while as long as val is less than or equal to 10
        while(val <= 10){
        sum += val;
        ++val;
        }
        std::cout << "Sum of 1 to 10 inclusive is"
                  << sum << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }

> **While has the form:**
> While(condition){
> statement
> }

###Home work (1.9-1.11)
Exercise1.9

    #include <iostreame>
    int main()
    {
        int sum = 50, val = 51;
        while(val <= 100){
        sum += val;
        ++val;
        }
        std::cout << "The sum of 50 to 100 is"
                  << sum << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }
Exercise1.10

    #include <iostream>
    int main()
    {
       
    }
Exercise1.11

    #include <iostream>
    int main()
    {
       
    }
**The For Statement**
Here is the example:

    #include <iostream>
    int main()
    {
       int sum = 0;
       //sum values from 1 through 10 inclusive
       for( int val = 1, val <= 10, ++val){
       sum += val;
       }
       std::cout << "Sum of 1 to 10 inclusive is"
                 << sum << std::endl;
       return 0;
    }
